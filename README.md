## Introduction

Gas Effect is an interactive web application that lets the user experience a gas spreading like effect. Users can draw on a canvas, and the application dynamically responds to their actions, creating a unique and engaging experience. The application features a range input that allows users to adjust the size of the drawing blocks, offering a customizable experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Canvas**: Users can draw on the canvas with their mouse.
- **Dynamic Response**: The application dynamically updates the canvas in real-time, creating a visually appealing effect.
- **Customizable Block Size**: Users can adjust the size of the drawing blocks using a range input, allowing for a customizable drawing experience.
